# Client (Next.js + React)

This is the frontend workspace of the monorepo generated by Kaivian-Template. It uses Next.js App Router with React 18 and Heroui for UI components.

## Prerequisites
- Node.js >= 18
- npm >= 9

## Getting Started
From the monorepo root, install dependencies and start the client:
```bash
npm install
npm run dev -w client
```
Alternatively, run directly from the client workspace:
```bash
cd client
npm install
npm run dev
```

By default, the app runs at http://localhost:3000. The dev server uses Turbopack for fast HMR.

## Scripts
From the monorepo root using the workspace flag:
- `npm run dev -w client`   – Start Next.js in development
- `npm run build -w client` – Build for production
- `npm run start -w client` – Start production server (after build)
- `npm run lint -w client`  – Lint and auto-fix

From within `client/` directly:
- `npm run dev`
- `npm run build`
- `npm start`
- `npm run lint`

## Project Structure
```
client/
├─ package.json
├─ app/               # Next.js App Router pages and layouts (e.g., layout.tsx, page.tsx)
├─ components/        # Shared UI components
├─ config/            # App configuration (e.g., site.ts)
├─ public/            # Static assets
└─ eslint.config.mjs  # ESLint configuration
```

## UI Library (Heroui)
The client includes Heroui components. Refer to https://heroui.com/ for usage and theming guidelines.

## Environment Variables
Create a `.env.local` file in the `client/` folder for client-side config. Variables must be prefixed with `NEXT_PUBLIC_` to be exposed to the browser, e.g.:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:5000
```
Adjust to match the server URL and port you use.

## Connecting to the Server
If your server runs on a different port (e.g., 5000), ensure API calls point to `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` or similar configuration.

## Troubleshooting
- Port already in use: close the app using port 3000 or change the port with `-p` (e.g., `next dev -p 3001`).
- Types/ESLint errors: run `npm run lint -w client` to auto-fix common issues.
- Styles not applying: ensure Tailwind/PostCSS (if used) are properly configured and imported.
