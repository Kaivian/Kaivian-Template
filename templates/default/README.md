# Kaivian App

A full-stack application generated by Kaivian-Template.

## Tech Stack
- Backend: Node.js (workspace: `server`)
- Frontend: Next.js + React (workspace: `client`)
- UI: Heroui
- Package manager: npm workspaces
- License: MIT © 2025 Your Name

## Getting Started
Install dependencies and start development servers for both workspaces:
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

This runs `server` and `client` concurrently. Open the client URL it prints (usually http://localhost:3000).

## Scripts
From the project root:
- `npm run dev`   - Run server and client in parallel (development)
- `npm run build` - Build server then client (production)
- `npm start`     - Start both in production (after build)

To run scripts within a specific workspace:
```bash
npm run dev -w server
npm run dev -w client
```

## File Structure
```
./
├─ LICENSE
├─ package.json            # npm workspaces & orchestration scripts
├─ server/                 # Node.js backend

```

## Environment Variables
Copy `.env.example` to `.env` in the `server` workspace and adjust values as needed.

## Notes
- `node_modules` folders are not included in the scaffold; run `npm install` before starting.
- Keep dependencies inside their respective workspaces; shared tooling can live at the root.
